## 🔹 About Me

I am a **SaaS Architect and Product Owner** with over 15 years of experience building and scaling high-performance digital ecosystems.

My approach—often described as **"Unicorn Engineering"**—bridges the gap between deep technical architecture and strategic product growth. I don't just write code; I architect solutions that reduce business risk and drive long-term scalability.

**Current Focus:** Lead Architect and Owner of **@Clever-Certificates**, a global SaaS platform I acquired after 6 years of technical leadership.

**Technical Powerhouse:** I maintain an elite pace of innovation with over **1,200+** contributions in the last year alone.

**Global Impact:** I have delivered complex SaaS engines, payment orchestration systems, and real-time apps for founders across the **US, UK, and Australia**.

### 🛡️ Proven Trust & Ownership

* **From Architect to Owner:** In 2024, I successfully acquired **@Clever-Certificates**. This transition from lead consultant to owner defines my commitment to building long-term, viable product architectures.
* **Elite Professional Reputation:** I maintain a **100% Job Success Score** on Upwork as a **Top Rated Plus** consultant, specializing in high-stakes projects for international founders.
* **Thought Leadership:** I write about the intersection of engineering and business.
