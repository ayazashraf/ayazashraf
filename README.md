## 🔹 About Me

I am a **SaaS Architect and Product Owner** with over 15 years of experience building and scaling high-performance digital ecosystems.

**Current Focus:** I am the Lead Architect and Owner of **Clever Certificates**, a global SaaS platform I acquired after 6 years of technical leadership.

**Technical Powerhouse:** I maintain an elite pace of innovation with over **1,200+** contributions in the last year alone.

**Global Impact:** I have delivered complex SaaS engines, payment orchestration systems, and real-time apps for founders across the **US, UK, and Australia**.

**Proven Trust:** On **Upwork**, I maintain a **100% Job Success Score** with $60k+ earned across 39+ high-value projects.
